    "text": "Our goal is to identify landslide sites using changes in ground-surface elevation resolved between sequential aerial lidar acquisitions. We could work with the lidar point clouds directly for this task, but we would like to take advantage of raster-processing algorithms for image segmentation and topographic analyses, so we want to evaluate the potential of working with the raster DTMs derived from the lidar point-cloud ground returns. Specifically, we here evaluate elevation-difference rasters, referred to as “DEMs of Difference (DoDs)” (R. D. Williams 2012). A DoD is obtained by subtracting one DTM1 from another.\nIn using two (or more) lidar data sets to detect elevation change, it is necessary to ensure that the data sets are spatially aligned (Cucchiaro et al. 2020). Differences in spatial registration between the data sets will produce systematic errors in measured elevation differences. In the study design, we described approaches that have been used for co-registration of lidar datasets. These involve two strategies:\n\nCo-register the lidar point-cloud ground returns, then build the two DTMs.\nBuild the two DTMs, then coregister one DTM to align with the other.\n\nThe first approach seems likely to be the more consistent of the two, because consistent methods can be used for filtering ground returns from both point clouds and for interpolation of the DTMs from the ground returns. When using existing DTMs, e.g., those downloaded from the Washington Lidar Portal, they may have been generated with different point-filtering algorithms and interpolation schemes. However, working with point clouds directly is computationally intensive and time consuming. If we can obtain good results with the existing DTMs, that will reduce time and computer requirements (Li et al. 2023).\nBoth approaches must address errors in the two lidar data sets. Besides the systematic errors associated with differences in the spatial registration of the point clouds and resulting DTMs, sources of error include uncertainty in the elevation and location of each laser-signal reflection represented by points in the point cloud, laser reflections from vegetation interpreted as ground returns, and uncertainty as to what the elevation is in between ground-return locations. These errors and uncertainties carry through to a DTM built by interpolating from the ground-return points to a DTM grid. The DoD obtained by subtracting one DTM from another will include the combined effects of the errors and uncertainties in both DTMs.\nThe magnitude of these errors and uncertainty affect the confidence we can place in inferences made using the DTMs and the resulting DoD. We need to account for this uncertainty when coregistering one DTM to the other and when mapping landslide scars and deposits using the DoD. A common way to account for this uncertainty is by determining a “minimum level of detection” (LoD) (e.g., Wheaton et al. 2010). The LoD is generally set so that we can assume a specified level of confidence that DoD values greater than the LoD represent actual changes in ground-surface elevation. Differences less than the LoD fall within the range of inherent noise in the DoD and may or may not represent true changes in ground elevation.\nIn the next sections we describe a method for estimating an LoD value and using it to guide co-registration of the two DTMs and identification of landslide scars and deposits.",

    "text": "Canopy effects.\nSee Figure 13 below. The left panel shows elevation differences draped on a shaded relief image for a portion of the overlapping 2006 and 2017 DTMs after coregistration; the right panel shows an aerial photo view of the same area. Over the low-gradient, low-relief, and unforested fields and pastures, differences between the two DTMs are minor. Over the forested hillslopes, the speckled pattern in the left panel indicates variability in DTM elevations on the order of several tens of centimeters over horizontal length scales of a few to ten meters, consistent with a general reduction of lidar DTM accuracy observed over forested areas (Simpson, Smith, and Wooster 2017).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: The left panel shows differences in DTM elevations after coregistration. The right panel shows an aerial photo view of the same area.\n\n\n\nThere are two likely primary reasons for the increased variability over forested areas (Petras et al. 2023):\n\nIncreased spacing of lidar ground returns because of reflections from the forest canopy, and\nInterpretation of canopy reflections as ground returns.\n\nThe first of these is illustrated in Figure 14 and Figure 15 below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: The left panel shows the number of lidar ground returns within each cell of the 2006 DTM (3-foot DTM point spacing). The right panel zooms into the area within the box of the left panel. Black dots indicate ground returns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: The left panel shows the ground-return point density for the 2006 lidar measured over a 7.5-m radius. The right panel shows an areal view of the area in the summer of 2006. Low point densities (blues) align with unforested fields and clearcuts.\n\n\n\nVariation in ground-return spacing results in variable-sized gaps with no returns and variable spatial density in the number of signals per DTM cell. The bar chart in Figure 16 below shows the proportion of all cells in the 2006 DTM that overlapped the 2017 DTM containing a given number of ground returns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Proportion of 2006 DTM cells with a given number of ground returns\n\n\n\n\n\nThe variable spacing between ground returns results in variable lengths over which elevations are interpolated to the DTM grid points. Topographic detail between ground-return points is lost. The gaps in ground return points will differ between the two DTMs. In rough terrain, small features resolved in one DTM might thus be missed in the other, resulting in differences in the interpolated ground elevations.\nA variety of factors can result in variable lidar point spacing (Yan 2023; Petras et al. 2023). For example, the systematic north-west to south-east trending variations in point density visible in the left panel may result from differences in the extent of swath overlap between adjacent flight lines as the lidar was collected. Random variations in point density in forested areas may result from spatial variability in the proportion of laser signals that penetrate through the tree canopy. Additionally, some of the ground returns may actually be misinterpreted reflections from tree canopy or understory vegetation, which introduces random errors into the DTM elevations.\nAfter coregistration of the 2006 and 2017 DTMs, we found that variability in elevation differences, as measured by the interquartile range (Figure 9) ranged from about 10 to 30 centimeters, increasing with increasing hillslope gradient. Figure 17 below shows the same data, but here parsed by hillslope gradient and tree-canopy height. Canopy height was determined in program Align after shifting the 2017 DSM4 by subtracting the DTM elevation from the DSM elevation at each grid point and using the maximum of the 2006 or 2017 canopy heights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Variation of the interquartile range with changes in canopy height and hillslope gradient.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe upper panel in Figure 17 shows the increase in interquartile range with hillslope gradient; the lower panel shows a slight increase in interquartile range with canopy height. To characterize the combined hillslope-gradient and canopy-height dependence, we fit the \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_3\\) values over all gradient-canopy height bins with an equation quadratic in both canopy height H and hillslope gradient \\(\\theta\\):\n\\[\nq = (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\theta + \\beta_2 \\theta^2) + (\\beta_3 + \\beta_4 H + \\beta_5 H^2) + \\beta_6 H \\theta + \\beta_7H^2\\theta + \\beta_8H\\theta^2 + \\beta_9H^2\\theta^2\n\\tag{4}\\]Figure 18 below shows the interquartile range and Tukey fences as functions of canopy height for a range of gradient interval. The black circles show \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_3\\) from the binned \\(\\Delta e\\) values, the thin black lines show the curves fit to the \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_3\\) values using Equation 4, and the thick black lines show the Tukey fences with \\(k=1.5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18: The interquartile range and LoD (Tukey’s fences with k=1.5) plotted as a function of canopy height for different increments in hillslope gradient.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19 below shows the same data, but plotted as a function of hillslope gradient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19: The interquartile range and LoD (Tukey’s fences with k=1.5) plotted as a function of hillslope gradient for different increments in canopy height.\n\n\n\n\n\nVariability in the range of elevation differences varies with both hillslope gradient and forest-canopy height. These curves account for both effects.\nWe are using the LoD defined by these graphs to identify “stable” locations where elevations have probably not changed between the 2006 and 2017 lidar acquisitions. We used the elevation differences over these stable locations to solve for the horizontal (\\(\\Delta x, \\Delta y\\)) and vertical (\\(\\Delta z\\)) shifts needed to bring the 2017 DTM into alignment with the 2006 DTM, using Equation 2. The range spanned by this LoD, ± 0.5m, is sufficient, however, to include things like flood plain or fan aggradation.\nThere may stil be systematic biases in the random errors associated with lidar signal reflections from vegetation interpreted as ground returns. A plantation that grows 2 meters over that 11 years may generate larger mean positive errors in 2017 DTM elevations than in 2006 DTM elevations, resulting in a positive bias in elevation differences measured over that area. Likewise, an area harvested between 2006 and 2017 will generate a negative bias. Figure 20 below shows quartiles of \\(\\Delta e\\) measured over 5-meter increments of canopy-height change between 2006 and 2007. Negative \\(\\Delta H\\) values indicate a loss of canopy (timber harvest) or vegetation (mowing of a pasture). Positive values indicate canopy or vegetation growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20: First, second, and third quartiles of Δe for increments of change in canopy height (ΔH) between 2006 and 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see a slight trend for increasing \\(\\Delta e\\) values moving from negative to positive \\(\\Delta H\\) values. This is consistent with the expectation that a loss of canopy (negative \\(\\Delta H\\)) will generate a negative bias and that canopy growth will generate a positive bias. The deviation is small, on the order of 5 cm. However, this observation prompted inclusion of the \\(\\Delta H\\) term in Equation 2.\nNext: identify landslide scars using the DoD.",
